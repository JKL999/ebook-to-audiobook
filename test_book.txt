Chapter 1: The Beginning

This is a test book for our audiobook converter. It contains a simple story that we can use to test the text-to-speech functionality.

Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a young programmer who wanted to convert ebooks to audiobooks. They worked day and night to create a tool that would help people enjoy books in a new way.

Chapter 2: The Journey

The programmer faced many challenges. First, they had to learn how to extract text from different file formats. PDFs were particularly tricky, as some were scanned images rather than text.

But with persistence and the help of modern Python libraries, they eventually succeeded in creating a working prototype.

Chapter 3: Success

Finally, the tool was ready. People could now convert their favorite books into audiobooks and listen to them while commuting, exercising, or relaxing.

The end.
