- **Few-shot TTS**: 1-minute training data optimal
- **Languages**: English, Japanese, Korean, Cantonese, Chinese
- **Voice Similarity**: 80-95% achievable with good samples

## ‚ö° Performance Expectations

### Estimated Training Times (RTX 3070)
- **Voice Training**: 30-60 minutes per model
- **GPU Utilization**: Expected 80-90% during training
- **Memory Usage**: 6-7GB VRAM during training
- **Inference Speed**: Real-time generation expected

### Quality Metrics (Target)
- **Voice Similarity**: 8-9/10 with good training data
