## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Voice Provider Architecture
```python
# Custom voice integration with existing system
from ebook2audio.voices import (
    get_voice_manager, 
    create_custom_voice,
    discover_custom_voices
)

# Automatic model discovery and registration
voices = discover_custom_voices("models/custom_voices/")
voice_manager = get_voice_manager()
```

### Model Loading System
- **Format Support**: .pth, .pt checkpoint files
- **Device Mapping**: Automatic CPU/MPS device selection
- **Model Structure**: GPT-SoVITS compatible with config extraction
- **Memory Management**: Efficient loading and caching

### Integration Points
- **Voice System**: Fully integrated with existing BaseTTSProvider interface
- **Configuration**: Compatible with ConversionConfig voice selection
- **Fallback System**: Automatic fallback to gTTS/pyttsx3 if custom voice fails
- **Pipeline**: Ready for audiobook processing workflow
