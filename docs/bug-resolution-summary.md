# Bug Resolution Summary

## Bug 1: GPTSoVITS Integration Issues - RESOLVED ✅

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Fixed GPTSoVITS Provider Implementation**
   - Updated `src/ebook2audio/voices/gpt_sovits_provider.py` to use the correct inference CLI
   - Changed from using incomplete `lky_audiobook_inference` to direct GPT-SoVITS inference_cli.py
   - Fixed argument names to match actual inference_cli.py requirements
   - Implemented proper text file handling for reference and target text

2. **Model Path Configuration**
   - Correctly identified model locations:
     - S1 model: `GPT-SoVITS/logs/lky_en_enhanced/lky_en_enhanced-e50.ckpt`
     - S2 model: `GPT-SoVITS/GPT_SoVITS/pretrained_models/gsv-v2final-pretrained/s2G2333k.pth`
   - Created 5-second reference audio to meet 3-10 second requirement

3. **Working Directory Issues**
   - Fixed output file location handling (inference_cli.py saves to `./output.wav`)
   - Implemented proper file moving to expected output location

### Result:
- GPT-SoVITS provider now successfully synthesizes audio with LKY voice
- Test confirmed working with 344KB output file generated

## Bug 2: Repository Organization Issues - RESOLVED ✅

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Fixed Hardcoded Paths**
   - Updated all training scripts to use relative paths with `Path(__file__).parent`
   - Fixed paths in:
     - train_lky_voice.py (6 paths)
     - train_lky_enhanced.py (7 paths)
     - train_s2_enhanced.py (4 paths)
     - test_enhanced_inference.py (1 path)
     - test_s1_model.py (1 path)
     - setup_gpt_sovits.py (4 paths)

2. **Updated Configuration**
   - Updated `voices.json` with correct model paths
   - All paths now relative to project root
   - Removed references to non-existent files

### Result:
- Scripts are now portable and work from any location
- No more hardcoded `/home/tim/` paths
- Configuration accurately reflects actual file locations

## Bug 3: Memory Limitations During Training - ANALYZED ✅

### Solution Status:
- S2 training configuration already optimized:
  - batch_size: 1 (minimum possible)
  - segment_size: 10240 (reduced from 20480)
  - grad_ckpt: true (gradient checkpointing enabled)
  - fp16_run: true (mixed precision enabled)
  - if_cache_data_in_gpu: false (GPU caching disabled)

### Additional Recommendations:
If still experiencing OOM errors:
1. Further reduce segment_size to 8192 or 5120
2. Implement gradient accumulation
3. Monitor GPU memory with `nvidia-smi`
4. Add periodic cache clearing in training loop
5. Consider using CPU for some operations

## Summary of Changes Made:

### Code Changes:
- ✅ Updated GPTSoVITS provider to use correct inference approach
- ✅ Fixed all hardcoded paths in training scripts
- ✅ Created 5-second reference audio for proper inference
- ✅ Updated voices.json with correct paths

### Documentation:
- ✅ Created comprehensive bug documentation
- ✅ Created file structure reference
- ✅ Created atomic bug resolution checklist
- ✅ Moved all documentation to `/docs` folder

### Testing:
- ✅ Verified GPT-SoVITS provider works with test script
- ✅ Confirmed audio synthesis produces valid output

## Next Steps:
1. Test full audiobook conversion with LKY voice
2. Monitor memory usage during actual S2 training
3. Create user guide for using the LKY voice
4. Consider creating more reference audio options
