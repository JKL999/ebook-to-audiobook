## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### Phase 1: Enhanced Dataset Creation
- **Extracted 30 high-quality LKY speech segments** from raw audio recording
- **Processed 93MB raw audio file** with 671 timestamp entries from TSV file
- **Utilized existing whisper-transcriber infrastructure** for audio segmentation
- **Implemented quality filtering** to ensure clean training samples (RMS energy, silence ratio)
- **Generated comprehensive training dataset** at `/GPT-SoVITS/output/lky_training_data_enhanced/`

### Phase 2: Enhanced S1 (GPT) Model Training
- **Completed full 50-epoch training** of Stage 1 (GPT) model
- **Successfully processed all 30 training samples** (90 total audio segments)
- **Generated 75.7MB trained model**: `logs/lky_en_enhanced/lky_en_enhanced-e50.ckpt`
- **Achieved stable training convergence** with proper loss reduction
- **Validated model loading and functionality** - all tests pass

### Phase 3: Infrastructure & Configuration
- **Created enhanced training configuration** files for both S1 and S2 stages
- **Established proper dataset preprocessing** pipeline (text, HuBERT, semantic)
- **Configured environment variables** and dependencies for training
- **Implemented training validation** and testing scripts
