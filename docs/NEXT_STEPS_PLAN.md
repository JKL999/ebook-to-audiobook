*Date: July 4, 2025*

## 🎯 Current Status: Enhanced Model Training COMPLETE ✅

### What's Been Accomplished
- ✅ **Enhanced S1 (GPT) Model**: Fully trained with 30 samples (75.7MB model)
- ✅ **Dataset Creation**: 30 high-quality LKY speech segments extracted and processed
- ✅ **Training Infrastructure**: Complete pipeline and validation tools created
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive progress reports and technical details
- ✅ **Local Commits**: All work committed locally (ready for push to GitHub)

---

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Push to GitHub** (When Ready)
```bash
cd /home/tim/Projects/ebook-to-audiobook
git push origin main
```
*Note: All commits are saved locally. 2 commits ahead of origin/main including the enhanced model work.*

### 2. **Integrate Enhanced Model with Audiobook Pipeline**
**Location**: `/home/tim/Projects/ebook-to-audiobook/src/ebook2audio/voices/`

**Tasks**:
- Update voice configuration to use enhanced S1 model:
  - Model path: `GPT-SoVITS/logs/lky_en_enhanced/lky_en_enhanced-e50.ckpt`
  - Reference audio: `GPT-SoVITS/output/lky_training_data_enhanced/audio_segments/lky_segment_0033.wav`
- Test with sample text or ebook chapter
- Compare quality vs. previous model

**Key Files to Update**:
- `src/ebook2audio/voices/custom_trained_provider.py`
- `src/ebook2audio/voices/gpt_sovits_provider.py`
- `voices.json` (add new enhanced LKY voice entry)

### 3. **Production Testing**
- Generate test audiobook samples using enhanced model
- Validate voice quality, consistency, and naturalness
- Performance benchmarking (speed, memory usage)

## 🔧 Integration Code Template

### Example Voice Configuration Update
```python
# In voices.json or voice provider
{
    "name": "lky_enhanced",
    "display_name": "Lee Kuan Yew (Enhanced)",
    "provider": "gpt_sovits",
    "config": {
        "s1_model_path": "GPT-SoVITS/logs/lky_en_enhanced/lky_en_enhanced-e50.ckpt",
        "s2_model_path": "GPT-SoVITS/pretrained_models/gsv-v2final-pretrained/s2G2333k.pth",
        "reference_audio": "GPT-SoVITS/output/lky_training_data_enhanced/audio_segments/lky_segment_0033.wav",
        "reference_text": "The characteristics they have in common were self-confidence",
        "language": "en"
    }
}
```

### Test Command Template
```bash
# Test the enhanced model
cd /home/tim/Projects/ebook-to-audiobook

## 🎯 Success Metrics for Integration

### Quality Validation
- [ ] **Audio Quality**: Clear, natural speech without artifacts
- [ ] **Voice Consistency**: Maintains LKY characteristics throughout longer text
- [ ] **Pronunciation**: Correct English pronunciation and intonation
- [ ] **Performance**: Reasonable generation speed for audiobook production

### Comparison Tests
- [ ] **Before/After**: Compare with previous 1-sample model
- [ ] **Reference Match**: Generated audio should sound like LKY
- [ ] **Text Variety**: Test with different types of content (technical, narrative, etc.)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### S2 Model Training (When More GPU Memory Available)
- Current constraint: 7.66GB GPU, needs ~8-10GB for batch training
- Solutions: Cloud GPU, gradient checkpointing, or smaller batch sizes
- Config ready: `GPT-SoVITS/configs/lky_enhanced_s2.json`

### Additional Dataset Expansion
- Extract more segments from raw audio if quality needs improvement
- Add more diverse LKY speech samples
- Fine-tune extraction quality parameters
