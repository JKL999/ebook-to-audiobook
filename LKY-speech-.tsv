660000	662000	Mr. Richard Fisher.
662000	664000	Ladies and gentlemen.
664000	680000	In February this year, Dean and I invited me to be the first visiting fellow of the Collins family international fellowship founded in honor of the late Congressman James Collins from Texas.
680000	696000	It's a program to highlight the careers of some of the world's most distinguished leaders so that these leaders may serve as role models for future generations of emerging leaders, students of public policy, scholars and practitioners.
696000	702000	That's in quotes I hesitated to accept.
702000	708000	Feeling that perhaps it sent it to the wrong person.
708000	718000	My work was on a small frame of an island some 224 square miles at low tide.
718000	724000	Not to be compared with a wide canvas of other world leaders.
724000	736000	First question I ask in writing this speech, are there lessons on leadership?
736000	746000	It's easier to recognize a man who is already a leader than to identify one before he becomes a leader.
746000	754000	During my 40 years in office I've met many foreign leaders in government, in the military and in business.
754000	769000	The characteristics they have in common were self-confidence, breath of mind, the ability to see the woods for the trees and the ability to communicate.
769000	777000	I'm familiar with most of the first generation of anti-colonial leaders to which I belong.
777000	788000	They all had strong nationalist anti-colonial convictions and wanted to prove that their people or their peoples could measure up to their former rulers.
788000	799000	Unhappily, many third world leaders who had successfully demolished the old order failed to build a new one.
799000	807000	Because building a new order demanded different and more complex capabilities.
807000	817000	Decision making in economics to achieve the highest returns on capital was not their forte.
817000	826000	They could enthuse their followers to keep up the fight against the old regime.
826000	834000	And they had oversimplified what needed to be done after the colonizers had handed over power.
834000	847000	Many leaders actually believed their own rhetoric that once they were rid of their exploiters, there would be wealth of plenty to go around.
847000	853000	And the economic models that they admired were socialists.
853000	861000	So why did these leaders follow the wrong model? Were they ignorant?
861000	869000	On the contrary, many like Michael Manley, the late prime minister of Jamaica, they were highly intelligent men.
869000	877000	And he was a graduate of a distinguished institution, the London School of Economics.
877000	885000	And they admired the early independence heroes, Nehru, Sukarno, Mao Tse Tung, Tito.
885000	893000	None of these early freedom fighters believed that wealth was something that had to be created by entrepreneurs.
893000	906000	People who raised capital, organized workers to produce goods and services that others wanted and would pay for because their prices were competitive.
906000	910000	They all believed that there were shortcuts to prosperity.
910000	916000	And they thought the best way was by state intervention.
916000	923000	This was a mistake that otherwise well-intentioned leaders like Julius Nyerere of Tanzania made.
923000	931000	He was a good, honest Christian, but held doctrinaire ideas on how to modernize Tanzania.
931000	938000	His policies were ill-suited for a small-scale African agricultural economy.
938000	945000	And both Julius Nyerere and Kenneth Cowen of Zambia failed to develop their economies.
945000	960000	On the other hand, Jomo Kenyatta and his successor Daniel Arab Moi of Kenya made their country more prosperous in spite of considerable corruption.
960000	963000	What was the difference?
963000	973000	It lay in the interventionist state policies of the first two compared to the free market policies of Kenya.
973000	983000	I've been asked time and again, how was it that my colleagues and I avoided falling into this trap?
983000	992000	Before I answer this question, let me start by explaining how I became politicized.
992000	1004000	The first turning point of my life was World War II, the way the British was routed by the Japanese.
1004000	1013000	Before the war broke out, our British rulers feared that the Asians would panic if bombs and shells fell upon them.
1013000	1023000	When the bombs and shells actually came, it was the British bosses who were shot and packed their families off.
1023000	1041000	The Chinese, Indian, and Malay subjects stoically bore their sufferings. That aura of overwhelming superiority with which the British held us in thrall was broken, never to be restored.
1041000	1049000	Another turning point was the experience of the brutality and cruelty of our Japanese conquerors.
1049000	1056000	They had portrayed themselves as liberators of fellow Asians from the white man,
1056000	1067000	but they left us in no doubt that they were the new masters of the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.
1067000	1077000	And to punish the Chinese in Singapore for supporting the Nationalist government of China with donations to fight Japanese aggression,
1077000	1095000	within the first 15 days of their conquests of Singapore, they picked off at random 50,000 to 100,000 Chinese youths out of concentration centers and machine gunned them on the beaches.
1095000	1108000	I had first-hand experience of Japanese militarism when a Japanese platoon decided to build themselves in my home.
1108000	1114000	My family had fled to the countryside, and it was four days of hell.
1114000	1127000	I was roughed up, slapped, made to kneel down by a sentry, kicked in the chest, sense sprawling because I did not know that I had to bow to him to cross the bridge.
1127000	1143000	I felt that the Dark Ages had descended upon us, and I watched 80,000 dejected British, Indian, and Australian troops march into captivity in 48 hours.
1143000	1149000	Many of my friends shared this harrowing experience.
1149000	1156000	We asked ourselves, why? What right had the Japanese to do this to us?
1156000	1164000	Why did the British not fight the Japanese more ferociously to defend us?
1164000	1173000	And when the British came back after three and a half years, after the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
1173000	1186000	the communists who had organized the resistance in the jungles of Malaya attempted to grab power as theirs, as of right.
1186000	1192000	But I feared them as much as I feared the Japanese.
1192000	1198000	As a result, many nationalists like me were born.
1198000	1203000	After the war, my contemporaries and I gathered in London.
1203000	1211000	We were studying in various universities in England, and there was ferment in the air.
1211000	1217000	India had got its independence in 1947.
1217000	1221000	So had Pakistan, Burma, Ceylon.
1221000	1226000	Why not Malaya, which then included Singapore?
1226000	1234000	The British cut off Singapore from Malaya as they prepared to give independence to the Malays in Malaya.
1234000	1250000	They wanted to keep Singapore as one link in a chain of naval bases from Portsmouth to Gibraltar to Suez to Aden to Singapore to Sydney.
1250000	1258000	But after the British lost Suez in 1956, they agreed to let us rejoin Malaya.
1258000	1261000	By then, it was too late.
1261000	1279000	The Malay majority was not prepared to treat their Chinese, Indian, and other ethnic groups as equal citizens when they became as numerous as the Malays.
1279000	1282000	What were my motivations?
1282000	1288000	First, to get rid of colonialism and be independent.
1288000	1296000	This got us involved in a fight against the communists who were well ahead of us in the struggle against the British.
1296000	1306000	Later, we rejoined Malaya and had to fight the Malay extremists who wanted to dominate other ethnic groups in Malaysia.
1306000	1314000	As a result, in less than two years of federation, Singapore was asked to leave.
1314000	1326000	And we had to agree because the alternative was bloodshed, which the Malaysian Prime Minister Tunkula Abdulrahman warned us.
1326000	1350000	So suddenly, in August 1965, we had to create a nation out of a motley collection of Chinese, Indians, Malays, and others who had come to Singapore to seek a better life, but not to be a nation.
1350000	1354000	How did we escape choosing the wrong model?
1354000	1361000	Well, we were helped by the examples of failed policies in many new countries.
1361000	1368000	India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, and Indonesia had gained their independence in the 1940s.
1368000	1372000	Ghana and Nigeria in the 1950s.
1372000	1376000	By 1965, they were not thriving.
1376000	1393000	India's Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had imbibed socialist theories from his generation of British philosophers, economists, and political scientists when he was a student at Cambridge.
1393000	1404000	A powerful factor then was the example of the British under Clement Attlee, whose Labour government had set out to equalize opportunities and results.
1404000	1411000	Their policies led to the nationalization of key industries.
1411000	1421000	Iron and coal, steel mills, petrochemicals, synthetic fiber plants, all became state enterprises.
1421000	1427000	So did the railways, the buses, and all manner of transportation.
1427000	1438000	For more than four decades, India made the same car, a 1950 Morris Oxford, in a state-run factory.
1438000	1442000	They called it a Hindustan.
1442000	1447000	No one checked the bottom line for rates of return on capital.
1447000	1452000	Profit was a dirty word associated with a capitalist.
1452000	1471000	Now let me confess that in my student days up at Cambridge in the 1940s after World War II, I was convinced that Britain's welfare state was the highest form of civilized society.
1471000	1477000	And in my teen years, I was a great admirer of Pandit Nehru.
1477000	1484000	But I could see that he had adopted the wrong model by the 1960s.
1484000	1490000	That he had set India on the path of a planned economy with concentration on heavy industries,
1490000	1502000	and his successors carried on with these policies until Prime Minister Narasingham Rao began to change course late in the mid-1990s.
1502000	1506000	But there was another compelling reason for pragmatic solutions.
1506000	1515000	In 1965, when we became independent, Indonesia under President Sukarno, a great auditor,
1515000	1530000	was waging an undeclared war, low intensity, which he called Konfrantasi, an Indonesian word for confrontation, against Singapore and Malaysia.
1530000	1539000	And in Malaysia, the Tunku, the Prime Minister, wanted to bypass Singapore as Malaysia's commercial outlet.
1539000	1546000	We could not afford to risk our future on theories.
1546000	1557000	We had a daunting task to create a new economy, not one so dependent on entrepot trade with our neighbors.
1557000	1564000	And independence brought worries for our future, not euphoria.
1564000	1572000	We were no longer the commercial, administrative, or military center of the British Empire and Southeast Asia.
1572000	1575000	The British were departing.
1575000	1588000	The odds were against our survival, and we had to ensure our own existence, which we had previously taken for granted.
1588000	1596000	Our first preoccupation for survival, which meant economic viability, had to be solved.
1596000	1599000	Next, security.
1599000	1602000	I cast around for solutions.
1602000	1612000	We reached out first to Hong Kong and Taiwan investors in textiles, garments, plastics, and low-value added products.
1612000	1625000	Later, a UNDP expert working in Singapore described to me how Israel had leapfrogged its neighbors,
1625000	1638000	neighbors who boycotted them, and exported to Europe and America fruits, flowers, many other things.
1638000	1651000	I thought to myself, why not seek links with the developed countries, get industrial investments from Europe, Japan, and America.
1651000	1656000	They came, but far and few between.
1656000	1667000	Then fortuitously, China went into a convulsion of the Cultural Revolution, and it reached a crescendo in 1967.
1667000	1674000	So computer companies like Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, National Semiconductors,
1674000	1682000	they passed over Taiwan and Hong Kong, and we attracted them to Singapore.
1682000	1690000	We had political stability, industrial peace, plus English as our working language, pull factors.
1690000	1699000	Twenty years later, we had become a major manufacturer of electronics, computers, and disk drives.
1699000	1706000	The leapfrog strategy succeeded.
1706000	1712000	I worked out another strategy, the other side of the coin.
1712000	1723000	That was to create or to turn Singapore, a third world island, into a first world oasis in a third world region,
1723000	1733000	so that entrepreneurs and their families from the first world would base themselves in Singapore whilst they explored the region.
1733000	1744000	So we established up-to-date facilities in communications and transportation, airport, container port, state-of-the-art telecoms and security,
1744000	1757000	personal and public security, health standards to approximate first world, and a living environment equal to the first world.
1757000	1766000	Later, we improved our cultural facilities, museums, symphony orchestras, visiting artists.
1766000	1777000	The hardware part was easy, getting people to change their habits to match first world infrastructure that they now had.
1777000	1782000	That was difficult, slow, and painful.
1782000	1790000	We made progress by a series of campaigns involving the whole population.
1790000	1797000	More courtesy, stop spitting, keep public laboratories clean.
1797000	1804000	Not a minor item if you want a tourist trade to prosper.
1804000	1815000	And no chewing gum if you don't want your train doors not to close.
1815000	1821000	And no litter. And no pickpockets.
1821000	1831000	One rewarding decision was to green up the island with trees, palms, shrubs, creepers, flowers, to make Singapore different.
1831000	1840000	We had rain all year round, sunshine, all we needed to do was to plant them and trim them.
1840000	1846000	And we involved the whole population in planting and caring for them.
1846000	1848000	And we made progress.
1848000	1859000	And slowly our people are now acting more like a first world civic society, although there's a long way to go.
1859000	1869000	They still have their telephones buzzing in concerts.
1869000	1875000	We had to do a U-turn to carry our people with us or we would fail.
1875000	1896000	In place of constant strife and agitation, we had to convince workers and their union leaders that unless we had industrial peace and worker cooperation with management to improve productivity, we would be overwhelmed by our unemployment.
1896000	1907000	The history of Singapore after independence was one hard, long slog to make ourselves relevant and useful to the world.
1907000	1918000	To add value to both foreign investments that we sought and those that we ourselves made with our savings.
1918000	1932000	Our next major task was to establish security, which had to be based on social cohesion of our many races, religions, languages, and cultures.
1932000	1949000	All successor governments of colonial regimes have inherited this problem of multi-tribal, multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-cultural solidarity, how to achieve it.
1949000	1956000	Because without a cohesive people at peace with each other, development was not possible.
1956000	1970000	Our solution to the problem of a young nation was a policy of deliberate gradualism in all matters which involved race, language, culture, and religion.
1970000	1989000	We have 77 percent Chinese but from different parts of China speaking different and mutually unintelligible dialects, 14 percent Malay Muslims from different parts of Malaysia and Indonesia,
1989000	2002000	8 percent Indians from different parts of India speaking totally different languages, the rest from Europe and other parts of Asia.
2002000	2013000	We needed a common language. Had we legislated for one, there would have been trouble. Which one?
2013000	2021000	So we encouraged everyone to learn two languages, English and the mother tongue.
2021000	2031000	English is no group's mother tongue, so no one gained any advantage, and we made it our working language.
2031000	2044000	We have not forced or pressure-cooked a national identity. We have refrained from suppressing ethnic cultures, languages, religions, or their sense of separate identity.
2044000	2050000	We aimed for integration, not assimilation.
2050000	2059000	Another critical decision I made within a year of independence was to build a national service armed force.
2059000	2072000	If we did not have the ability to defend ourselves, nobody, not even our own people, would have faith in our future.
2072000	2083000	Foreign and UN intervention would always come too late, so we studied the Swiss, the Swedes, and the Israelis.
2083000	2090000	The Israelis offered help to build a system for a totally national service armed force.
2090000	2097000	We now have a credible defense capability.
2097000	2105000	To produce results, we need a clean government with an effective civil service,
2105000	2112000	and we had to shape the administration to produce an effective instrument of policy.
2112000	2121000	This required strong, fair, and just leaders with the moral strength to command the respect of the people.
2121000	2127000	Unity in the core group of leaders ensured that we sent clear signals to our people
2127000	2134000	and avoided confusion that would have arisen if the team had bickered and split.
2134000	2144000	Leaders must have that sense of being trustees, that they are only temporarily in charge of the destinies of their people,
2144000	2156000	and that their duty is not only to discharge distrust, but also to pass it on to equally trustworthy and competent hands.
2156000	2163000	So luxurious living while our people were left in poverty and backwardness was out.
2163000	2172000	We ensured complete accountability and open separateness between personal assets and public funds.
2172000	2182000	Corruption, which has been a cancer in many societies, had to be eradicated and constantly kept down.
2182000	2189000	A government voted into office needs an efficient, honest administration staffed by officers,
2189000	2194000	recruited completely unmarried by a politically neutral body.
2194000	2203000	We had an impartial, capable public service commission with the chairman and members who were shrewd at assessing character.
2203000	2210000	Promotions and rewards of scholarships must be made to the best candidates,
2210000	2218000	and they have to share nation-building philosophy and the development goals of the political leaders.
2218000	2226000	They must also be adequately paid so that temptations would not be too difficult to resist.
2226000	2236000	Once a political system has been corrupted, right from the top, from the very top to the lowest rungs of the bureaucracy,
2236000	2242000	the problem is almost impossible to solve without a revolution.
2242000	2251000	The cleansing and disinfecting has to start from the top and go downwards in a thorough and systematic way.
2251000	2259000	It was a long and laborious process that can be carried out only by a very strong group of leaders
2259000	2265000	with the courage and the moral authority derived from unquestioned integrity.
2265000	2273000	We just managed it and stopped it before it got out of control.
2273000	2280000	Next, we decided that the people should be stakeholders.
2280000	2287000	Soon after separation, I resolved to enable every household to own their own home.
2287000	2291000	If you're going to get the people to take national service seriously,
2291000	2299000	I could not ask other people's sons to fight and die for the properties of the wealthy.
2299000	2308000	So we worked out a personal savings scheme that allowed them to own an apartment painlessly through installments over 20 years.
2308000	2314000	Today, 95% of Singaporean households are homeowners.
2314000	2325000	They have value between US$100,000 to US$400,000, between a three-room to a five-room apartment.
2325000	2331000	Without this homeownership, we would have become like Tokyo, Seoul, or Hong Kong,
2331000	2341000	where the voters in the city are disaffected when they have to pay a large proportion of their salaries in rents.
2341000	2348000	In Singapore, they have voted for the return of the government in nine successive general elections.
2348000	2357000	They know who will keep the property values of their homes up.
2357000	2362000	Policies must be pragmatic, not dogmatic.
2362000	2369000	I learned early to ignore political correctness and to reject conventional wisdom
2369000	2375000	when it did not accord with reality or my experience.
2375000	2383000	For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, it was politically correct to be anti-American and anti-multinationals.
2383000	2393000	The theory expounded by Latin Americans like Raul Prevesh was that multinationals would reduce them to dependency.
2393000	2396000	We did not accept this.
2396000	2400000	And we assiduously courted the MNCs.
2400000	2408000	They had the capital, the technology, the know-how, and the markets.
2408000	2416000	We decided it was the fastest way of learning on the job, working for them and with them.
2416000	2423000	Now, I believe it will be equally mistaken to follow mindlessly the current politically correct
2423000	2429000	and secondly advocated view that democracy is the precondition for economic development.
2429000	2436000	I know it's a heresy in Harvard, Cambridge.
2436000	2444000	The theory goes that without democracy, Russia could not develop a free market.
2444000	2448000	Russia could not develop a free market with or without democracy.
2448000	2461000	And it was not borne out by the experience of Taiwan, South Korea, or post-open-door China.
2461000	2468000	What a country needs for growth and progress is stability and good government,
2468000	2475000	one that is honest and effective and works for the benefit of the people.
2475000	2485000	Good government should never be shackled by theories however attractive and logically elegant.
2485000	2491000	From the outset, we decided that education was the key to our future.
2491000	2494000	In what language should we teach?
2494000	2502000	This was a sensitive and emotive issue involving the mother tongues and cultures of various races.
2502000	2507000	And I had to resist the pressure to make Chinese the primary language,
2507000	2511000	although 77% of the people were Chinese.
2511000	2516000	Instead, I made English the working language, not the official language, just the working language.
2516000	2520000	It must be practical.
2520000	2530000	And I allowed parents to choose between schools that taught in English and Chinese or Malay and Tama
2530000	2538000	or in Chinese with English or Malay in English and Tamil in English.
2538000	2541000	It was their choice.
2541000	2553000	And in a few years, parents realized that their children's future was best assured when they were competent in English.
2553000	2559000	In other words, English as the first language and the mother tongue as the second language
2559000	2564000	because even our Chinese banks were switching to English.
2564000	2570000	We expanded schools, built new technical institutes, polytechnics, and universities.
2570000	2575000	This proved decisive for our progress.
2575000	2588000	My final and most important decision was to prepare or rather to plan and prepare for succession and not leave it to chance.
2588000	2597000	After three successful elections in 10 years, since we first won and took office in 59,
2597000	2605000	my old guard colleagues and I were troubled by the caliber of the young men that we had been able to induct.
2605000	2614000	They were the best of our political activists, our supporters, professionals, academics with PhDs,
2614000	2618000	but they were not equal to the original team.
2618000	2623000	My original team had been thrown up by the upheavals of the Second World War
2623000	2630000	and were among the best of that generation.
2630000	2638000	Those that didn't have it were knocked out by sheer elimination of events.
2638000	2643000	Now we were not getting the best to volunteer to join us.
2643000	2646000	We had to identify potential leaders.
2646000	2649000	But how?
2649000	2653000	Well, some people are national alphas.
2653000	2661000	Activists in their school days are school prefects, sport captains, or presidents of college societies.
2661000	2668000	Alphas usually are extroverts with high energy levels.
2668000	2675000	But as these school and college leaders grew older, many did not measure up.
2675000	2681000	The valedictorian in school does not always make it after college.
2681000	2690000	Few of those voted in college as most likely to succeed make it in the real world.
2690000	2700000	As they grow older, they need other qualities to stay as leaders, higher levels of intellectual ability,
2700000	2712000	a steady character, judgment, a decision-making capability that can win the confidence of those around them.
2712000	2721000	Seven times from 1959 to 1990, before each election, I had to select 20 to 30 candidates
2721000	2729000	who were likely to make good as ministers, but first as members of parliament and then some as ministers.
2729000	2741000	The easiest attribute to determine is intelligence, performance and examinations, IQ tests, SAT scores.
2741000	2749000	They give a fair indication of analytical ability.
2749000	2753000	Many that we fielded with PhDs failed as ministers.
2753000	2756000	They lacked something.
2756000	2767000	When I learned from American corporate leaders that they used psychometric tests to recruit and promote their executives,
2767000	2774000	I recall the epic flight of the three astronauts on Apollo 13.
2774000	2779000	If you remember, their spaceship malfunctioned 3,000 miles out in space.
2779000	2784000	Any false move, and they would never return to Earth.
2784000	2789000	They remained calm, collected throughout the ordeal,
2789000	2797000	entrusting their fate to the men at ground control whose instructions they followed meticulously.
2797000	2809000	I concluded that NASA's psychological tests on the ground had successfully eliminated those who were prone to panic in a crisis.
2809000	2813000	I decided in 1980, therefore, to adopt their practice,
2813000	2820000	and I had psychological and psychometric tests to help us assess the character of candidates,
2820000	2832000	to weed out those who were not likely to succeed, but they couldn't tell us who was likely to succeed.
2832000	2836000	The prospect of failure forced us to talent spot.
2836000	2842000	After a high attrition rate at the beginning, we improved our selection methods.
2842000	2848000	We threw candidates into the deep end of the pool to test their political skills.
2848000	2858000	Finally, I was concerned that the government machinery of the 31 years had been customized to suit my work style,
2858000	2871000	so I made a conscious effort in my last two years to make room for my successor so that he can reconfigure the arrangements.
2871000	2880000	So when a new guard of men in their 40s and 50s took over in 1990, there was no crushing of gears.
2880000	2888000	And instead, in the 1990s, Singapore has repeatedly been rated by Transparency International in Berlin
2888000	2895000	among the top seven least corrupt countries in the world, the least corrupt in Asia.
2895000	2899000	And we have not become decadent and corrupt after 41 years in office.
2899000	2905000	The old guards set high standards because they were brought up that way.
2905000	2914000	The new guards have been able to maintain their self-discipline and integrity in the midst of growing affluence.
2914000	2922000	Our judiciary and the rule of law are rated by the World Economic Forum and the Institute of Management and Development in Geneva
2922000	2928000	and PERC, which is a rating agency in Hong Kong, as the best in Asia.
2928000	2933000	It commands the respect of the people and of our investors.
2933000	2942000	And Singapore is ranked by WEF and IMD as the second most competitive nation in the world after the United States.
2942000	2952000	They say I do not listen to my opponents. I do when they are serious opponents.
2952000	2960000	We studied all those items where we were rated poorly and we set out to do better.
2960000	2966000	We practiced lifelong learning before it became a buzzword.
2966000	2972000	What were the basic strengths that made this possible?
2972000	2980000	A basic idealism and an integrity that drives the whole system.
2980000	2983000	What new forces are at work?
2983000	2991000	The present leaders grew up in a Singapore that was stable and growing year by year.
2991000	2999000	People have got accustomed to the comforts of a modern, affluent society and expect life to be better every year.
2999000	3004000	Opinion polls are becoming a regular feature of public life.
3004000	3015000	Leadership has been reduced to the shaping of a policy so that somehow it would be able to carry the majority.
3015000	3024000	And if not the majority, then the plurality in the hope that it will expand into a majority by the next election.
3024000	3033000	I view this with mixed feelings as a totally different way from what I used to do.
3033000	3041000	In the 1960s, strikes, demonstrations, disorder and violence threatened our existence.
3041000	3044000	People faced dire choices.
3044000	3050000	Leaders had to lead, make bold decisions and act swiftly.
3050000	3056000	Only later did I have to convince the people to support our decisions.
3056000	3065000	For example, I had to carry out a campaign to win a referendum to take Singapore into Malaysia.
3065000	3074000	But when bloodshed threatened and the Malaysian government wanted Singapore to be out, I did not.
3074000	3080000	Indeed, I could not hold a referendum and consult the people before I took them out.
3080000	3082000	That would have meant disaster.
3082000	3094000	I took the decision, persuaded my cabinet colleagues to sign the separation agreement with me and embarked on independent Singapore.
3094000	3103000	To build a more stable Singapore, I did not discuss nor ask our different races whether they like to live integrated together in new high rises.
3103000	3109000	When we were building to replace the squatter huts, I knew what the answer was going to be.
3109000	3113000	They wanted to stay together.
3113000	3116000	But would that be good for us?
3116000	3133000	The British had allowed them to be segregated in the Malay villages, Chinese quarters and an Indian enclave because it was easier to rule such groups of people separated by race, language and religion.
3133000	3138000	We had to form a nation or try to.
3138000	3145000	So my colleagues and I decided that the people would ballot for their apartments.
3145000	3153000	And they would have Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians and others as their neighbours.
3153000	3156000	We did not seek their consent.
3156000	3159000	For the first few years, they were not comfortable.
3159000	3164000	After 10 years, it became a way of life.
3164000	3166000	We did the same in the schools.
3166000	3172000	My children used to be segregated into Malay, Chinese, Indian and English language schools.
3172000	3183000	Slowly and gradually, I persuaded parents to register their children for schools that use English and the mother tongue as a second language.
3183000	3191000	And when they did so, their children graduated into the best jobs.
3191000	3201000	Now we have schools with all races in mixed classrooms and integration has become a fact of life.
3201000	3212000	The business of government can be executed effectively only by people's representatives, exercising their judgments based on their mandate.
3212000	3222000	The people had given me a mandate to join Malaysia on fair terms and the Prime Minister of Malaysia was fearful of a bloodbath.
3222000	3226000	I exercised my judgment to separate without consulting the people.
3226000	3238000	So also racial integration and housing and schooling was part of my mandate given in elections every five years that I won.
3238000	3247000	The difference between the old guard and the new guard leaders are stark, reflecting the differences between the old society and the new.
3247000	3251000	The old society was a revolutionary situation.
3251000	3258000	People felt that everything, including their lives, were at stake.
3258000	3263000	They trusted their leaders and gave us unstinting support.
3263000	3270000	It was an inspired generation that fought against great odds to succeed as an independent country.
3270000	3275000	The new society is secure, comfortable, confident.
3275000	3290000	Many of the young believe that prosperity and stability to be theirs as of right and to consult them and that they must be consulted before any change is made which could affect them.
3290000	3300000	Well, this change is unavoidable, but does it mean that leaders have to govern by the polls as in many developed societies?
3300000	3314000	However, recent upheavals in Indonesia have brutally reminded Singaporeans of the volatility of their surroundings and alerted them to the dangers that lurk around them.
3314000	3332000	This may stop Singaporeans from becoming too complacent and consumer-driven a society and remind them that they need to make that extra effort to achieve more than the ordinary.
3332000	3343000	Many failures in the third world were the result of the leaders of the immediate post-independence period, the 1960s to the 80s.
3343000	3359000	Abiding by the theory then prevailing that socialism and state enterprises would hasten development, their interventionist economic policies led to a misallocation of resources and increased opportunities for corruption.
3359000	3365000	That theory was demolished as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
3365000	3387000	There is no reason why third world leaders cannot succeed in achieving growth and development if they can maintain social order, educate their people, maintain peace with their neighbors, and gain the confidence of investors by upholding the rule of law.
3387000	3394000	Finally, are great leaders born or are they the result of revolutionary situations?
3394000	3403000	From my experience, I think it's both, but more because of circumstances.
3403000	3417000	Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping were thrown out of a massive convulsion of 400 to 500 million Chinese after 100 years of decay and decline into warlordism and Japanese occupation.
3417000	3421000	Mao was the revolutionary who liberated China.
3421000	3427000	Deng was the builder who saved China from imploding like the Soviet Union.
3427000	3433000	Who was the greater leader, Mao or Deng?
3433000	3451000	As leader of the Chinese Communist Party in his fight to liberate China, Mao was unquestionably the unbeatable leader, a genius at guerrilla warfare who helped to defeat the Japanese and the Nationalist government.
3451000	3456000	But was he the modernizer of China?
3456000	3466000	If he lived on or had walked off, his immediate successor stayed in charge, China would have gone like the Soviet Union.
3466000	3475000	The Party heavyweights brought back Deng, a veteran of the Long March, and Deng was not an ideologue like Mao.
3475000	3485000	Ever the realist with a keen sense of the basics of the economy, he realized that the Communist system was not delivering.
3485000	3497000	He opened up China economically in 1979 or late 1978, kept a tight hold on political and social control of the country.
3497000	3510000	Although the opening up faltered after Tiananmen in 1989, he pushed it again in 1992 while on a southern tour of Guangdong province.
3510000	3523000	Had Deng followed Gorbachev in implementing both glasnost and perestroika at the same time, China would have collapsed in chaos.
3523000	3528000	Are there no great leaders of that caliber in China today?
3528000	3530000	Surely there must be.
3530000	3544000	But present day China requires a different kind of leader, not creators of liberation armies, but competent, imaginative builders of the economy
3544000	3554000	and flexible managers of the huge social and political changes that will flow from the opening up of China to the world.
3554000	3558000	The needs of a country vary from time to time.
3558000	3572000	China now has the prospect of becoming an advanced technological society in the next 50 years, provided its leaders can manage the changes to its economy and its society.
3572000	3586000	More important, they have to be courageous and skillful enough to adjust and change their political system to involve the better educated, more articulate and assertive people,
3586000	3599000	70% of whom will live in the cities and they will have to do all this without losing political stability.
3599000	3611000	Similarly, the difference in mood between America and Europe, both under threat in World War II and the comfortable consumer societies of the 1990s.
3611000	3616000	This explains the absence of towering leaders.
3616000	3626000	Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dean Acheson.
3626000	3631000	They were strong leaders, their people needed in times of crisis.
3631000	3638000	Neville Chamberlain gave way to Churchill who promised the British people blood, sweat and tears.
3638000	3652000	After Nazi Germany was defeated and the danger had passed, they voted in Clement Attlee as Prime Minister, Churchill's more mild-looking deputy during the war.
3652000	3660000	Similarly, de Gaulle became the symbol of French resistance to a German-occupied Vichy France under Marshal Petain.
3660000	3674000	He returned in triumph to Paris in 1944 but went into retirement after he made two partially successful attempts or unsuccessful attempts to reorganize the government.
3674000	3687000	He was recalled from retirement and elected president in 1958 by the National Assembly during a severe crisis over the stalemate of the Algerian War.
3687000	3694000	When France was restored to prosperity, the young wanted change and took to the streets.
3694000	3702000	De Gaulle resigned when he lost the referendum in 1969.
3702000	3713000	Security, prosperity and the consumer society plus mass communications have made for a different kind of person getting elected as leader.
3713000	3719000	One who can present himself and his program in a polished way.
3719000	3726000	Satellite television has allowed me to follow the American presidential campaign.
3726000	3741000	I'm amazed at the way media professionals can give a candidate a new image and transform him, at least superficially, into a different personality.
3741000	3749000	Winning an election becomes in large measure a contest in packaging and advertising.
3749000	3755000	These new techniques have been so successful that Europe has also bought into them.
3755000	3763000	A spin doctor now is a high-income professional, one in great demand.
3763000	3772000	From such a process, I doubt if a Churchill, a Roosevelt or a De Gaulle can emerge.
3772000	3777000	The difference between Winston Churchill and Tony Blair is the difference between their two societies.
3777000	3785000	One caught in a titanic struggle, the other comfortable and secure, facing no external threats,
3785000	3795000	reluctant to join Europe or reluctant to join the euro or to have his accustomed way of life upset in a federal Europe.
3795000	3801000	Revolutionary situations throw up great leaders who demand blood, sweat and tears.
3801000	3810000	Comfortable circumstances produce leaders who promise people an even easier life, whether they can deliver it or not.
3810000	3823000	But when the British felt that Britain was slipping, they voted for a conviction politician in Margaret Thatcher three times, from 1979 to 1990.
3823000	3829000	Similarly, when the Americans feared that their country was becoming weak during the Carter years,
3829000	3838000	when American diplomats were held as hostages in Tehran and the Soviet Union menacingly invaded Afghanistan,
3838000	3842000	they voted for Ronald Reagan for two terms.
3842000	3848000	Germany, defeated and divided after the war, produced Conrad Eisenhower.
3848000	3853000	Germany recovered and became the economic engine of Europe.
3853000	3856000	Germans still felt threatened and vulnerable.
3856000	3865000	They voted four times for another conviction politician, Helmut Kohl, who for 16 years cooperated closely with America
3865000	3869000	and established strong bonds with France.
3869000	3881000	When the opportunity came with the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, he seized the moment and by 1990 had reunified Germany.
3881000	3888000	With Germany reunited and the danger from Russia diminished, the people's mood changed.
3888000	3895000	In 1998, they voted Kohl out in favor of Gerhard Schröder.
3895000	3904000	Germans wanted a change to a new media-savvy generation of Bill Clinton's and Tony Blair.
3904000	3908000	This brings me to my last question.
3908000	3913000	Can you teach a person to be a leader?
3913000	3920000	Yes, if that person has the primary attribute to be a leader.
3920000	3932000	Then lessons in leadership will help him develop his skills and become more effective a leader with fewer costly errors.
3932000	3942000	Arnold Toynbee, in his massive study of history, argues that if the challenge is too great for a people,
3942000	3947000	they will fail however great the leader.
3947000	3953000	But that if there is no challenge, a people will not achieve much.
3953000	3963000	Fortunately for Singapore, the challenge was not beyond the capability of its leaders to draw the best out of the people.
3963000	3973000	If Singapore has once again to face circumstances as daunting as those in the first decade of its existence,
3973000	3980000	both people and leaders must be able to rise to the occasion for the country to survive.
3980000	3981000	Thank you.
3981000	4005000	Thank you.
4005000	4019000	Thank you.
4019000	4023000	We now have time for questions.
4023000	4029000	There are four microphones, two on the floor here and two in the balcony.
4029000	4038000	And I would like people to identify themselves before they ask their question and where they are at Harvard.
4038000	4047000	And also, I'd like to remind you that questions are brief and end with a question mark.
4047000	4054000	We've had the one speech we'll have this evening, and they also come one per customer.
4054000	4058000	So let me turn here.
4058000	4061000	Good evening, Senior Minister Lee.
4061000	4066000	My name is Felicity Specter, and I work at the Centre for Public Leadership here at the Kennedy School.
4066000	4074000	I'm also a television journalist from Britain, and it's in that aspect, if you'd like, that I ask my question.
4074000	4082000	When you were an opposition member of the Malay Parliament in 1964, you passionately defended the idea of a free press,
4082000	4087000	and you said if your ideas and your views cannot stand the challenge of criticism,
4087000	4091000	which is too fragile and not sturdy enough to last.
4091000	4100000	Why then, as the leader of Singapore, did you react to restrict the freedom of the press and of opponents within parliament?
4100000	4109000	And do you think this has stopped Singapore from becoming a first world civic society in the fullest sense of the meaning?
4109000	4117000	The consequences change and create new situations, and the individual must react to it.
4117000	4123000	Rhetoric is part of the business of leadership.
4123000	4126000	It is, it is.
4126000	4133000	But even as I said it in Malaysia, I knew that certain things were out of bounds.
4133000	4146000	In Singapore, when we had just separated and the Malays were unhappy and felt betrayed and abandoned,
4146000	4158000	for issues of race, language and religion to be raised in public would have been very dangerous.
4158000	4171000	Therefore, I think there's something wrong with you.
4171000	4190000	We've got the mike. His mike is gone.
4190000	4193000	Use mike.
4193000	4198000	It should be on? Okay, fine.
4198000	4207000	I do not believe that we had suppressed or stifled the opposition.
4207000	4212000	An open debate is necessary for any democracy.
4212000	4223000	But there are certain areas which, at various times in the people's history, are too sensitive for open discussion.
4223000	4234000	Let me explain. If in the 1960s I had raised the question of whether Chinese should or should not be the national language,
4234000	4238000	I might have ended up in a riot.
4238000	4247000	So I quietly called up the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and told them that if they wanted peace and quiet,
4247000	4255000	they should not be pressing for Chinese as the national language because that would immediately stir up such a hornet's nest,
4255000	4262000	fear in the Malays and the Indians who wouldn't be able to pass through that language and would be at each other's throats.
4262000	4269000	Now, in the more relaxed circumstances of the 1990s or the year 2000,
4269000	4274000	anybody can say what they like about language because the issue is quite clear.
4274000	4278000	Parents have decided that that is the way to the future.
4278000	4288000	But even today, if you have a free-for-all for religion, we're going to end up in a real mess.
4288000	4300000	I brought a case against the Far Eastern Economic Review in 1989 where they had accused me of attacking the Catholic Church,
4300000	4303000	which was completely unfounded.
4303000	4319000	So a very aggressive British QC gave me two days in the witness box to say, what's wrong?
4319000	4337000	I said to him that he could defend Salman Rushdie's book in England but that we had already decided to ban it before it became an issue.
4337000	4342000	Was it wise? I think it was.
4342000	4351000	What was the point of having this unnecessary rumpus, freedom of intellectual discussion,
4351000	4357000	when it was a matter that aroused enormous passion?
4357000	4362000	The Muslims in Singapore were not interested in what was in Salman Rushdie's book.
4362000	4375000	They were interested in the fatwa or the edict of the Iranian ayatollah and that anybody who killed Salman Rushdie would get a reward and go to heaven.
4375000	4380000	So in that situation, you begin to argue.
4380000	4395000	If you look at what's happening in the Middle East, I think much of the trouble really is that some things are not possible of civil discourse.
4395000	4400000	It arouses too much passion and emotion.
4400000	4407000	But as we become more affluent and comfortable and our malaise are more relaxed, perhaps we can do this.
4407000	4415000	But then we have neighbors who are quite easily agitated by what we are saying in Singapore.
4415000	4417000	So we have to be careful.
4417000	4423000	We are not Britain with the French to worry about or the Germans.
4423000	4432000	We have a different backdrop and we have to have a keen sense of survival.
4432000	4442000	My name is Tuxuan Wang. I'm the current Kennedy School student. My question is about the mainland China and Taiwan relationship, the so-called cross-street relationship.
4442000	4448000	I know you have a very good relationship with both the leaders in Beijing and the leaders in Taiwan.
4448000	4453000	You recently visited Taiwan and met the newly elected president, Chen Shibing.
4453000	4467000	So my question is how do you envision the cross-street relationship and how all the parties, including the mainland China, Taiwan, U.S., and Japan should take action to peacefully solve the problem?
4467000	4472000	I also know both President Jiang Zemin and President Chen Shibing respect you very much.
4472000	4474000	So you met them regularly.
4474000	4476000	Back me very much.
4476000	4478000	I respect you.
4478000	4479000	Respect me.
4479000	4483000	Yeah.
4483000	4484000	Sorry.
4484000	4487000	Respect you very much.
4487000	4494000	So in that sense, how do you define your role in solving the cross-street relationship problem?
4494000	4496000	Are you from Taiwan or the mainland?
4496000	4497000	I'm from Beijing.
4497000	4498000	From?
4498000	4499000	I'm from Beijing.
4499000	4508000	You're from Beijing.
4508000	4522000	I am on record as saying that this is a very difficult issue, one which could easily lead to an unfortunate conflict.
4522000	4533000	I have watched with growing concern the exchanges across the straits.
4533000	4546000	And I think at some time a decision has to be reached on the formula that will restart talks and reduce tensions.
4546000	4556000	That formula that Beijing has clearly defined as the one-China principle.
4556000	4569000	Taiwan believes that if it agrees to the one-China principle, then it's already in the box, that it can't go anywhere else but one China.
4569000	4586000	My best interlocutor was Professor Lee Yuan Tse, the Taiwanese Nobel Prize winner who's now collecting a cross-party consensus.
4586000	4600000	He said, and I think he's right if you go by the voting figures, that 70% of the people in Taiwan do not want immediate reunification.
4600000	4610000	At the same time, 70% of the people of Taiwan also do not want independence because they would have grave consequences.
4610000	4614000	So what they would like is the status quo.
4614000	4624000	I asked him how long could the status quo last if during the status quo, in the last 12 years,
4624000	4635000	former President Li Teng-hui moved from the one China to each his own explanation into the two-state theory.
4635000	4644000	And that if that went on to another four years, it is not unlikely that the mainland would do something.
4644000	4652000	So he said, and I repeated what he said to make sure that it's public knowledge,
4652000	4666000	that the one China issue cannot be avoided, pukatopita, he said, and that that one China can be the umbrella
4666000	4674000	that will enable the status quo to remain non-confrontational.
4674000	4683000	So I'm waiting for him to collect his consensus and maybe some action will be taken.
4683000	4690000	But if not, then I am not optimistic about the outcome.
4690000	4702000	I left slightly less pessimistic because I concluded that President Chen Shui-pien was a different personality and character from President Li Teng-hui.
4702000	4705000	President Li Teng-hui is an ideologue.
4705000	4713000	He believes he has a mission, that he is Moses and has the promised land that he must lead the Taiwanese people to.
4713000	4717000	President Chen Shui-pien has just won an election by a minority.
4717000	4726000	He has a big problem of getting his policies through because the legislative UN is controlled by other parties
4726000	4730000	and the elections next year is not likely to change that.
4730000	4747000	So he is preoccupied with political survival and not with dramatic earth-shaking moves that will convert Taiwan into something different.
4747000	4754000	So I think that is room for less pessimism.
4754000	4760000	So I hope the mainland will be patient and maybe they will come to the same conclusion as I have,
4760000	4768000	that perhaps he will look for a way out to save his position with his party.
4768000	4776000	Because the other two parties, the KMT and the People's First Party of Jamesong,
4776000	4784000	that's about 60 plus percent of the votes, they are for going back to the 1992 consensus.
4784000	4792000	So there is already a majority for going back to that consensus.
4792000	4796000	Thank you. We have the next question on the left side of the balcony.
4796000	4798000	Good evening. My name is Hector.
4798000	4803000	I'm a graduate student here at the Kennedy School.
4803000	4810000	To me, one of the most interesting things of your speech was the fact that you mentioned that for development to occur,
4810000	4821000	you had to change some of the habits, the cultural traits, the everyday things that people did in Singapore
4821000	4828000	and kind of like make it more seem like Western societies, although not assimilate.
4828000	4836000	This has been promoted in many Latin American countries where there are democratic societies
4836000	4840000	and there has been opposition to this and it has not been implemented because of that.
4840000	4843000	It has also been promoted in the Middle East.
4843000	4853000	So I'm wondering, what is it about the society in Singapore that facilitated the incorporation of the values that you were promoting?
4853000	4861000	Was there something inherent to society in Singapore that facilitated this as opposed to another country?
4861000	4863000	Are you Latin American?
4863000	4866000	Yes, I'm from Puerto Rico.
4866000	4874000	But that's not Latin America.
4874000	4880000	Culturally, it is.
4880000	4886000	Okay, I accept your definition of yourself.
4886000	4889000	I don't think I've made myself clear.
4889000	4895000	We did not change the cultural habits, the cultural beliefs or value systems of the people.
4895000	4901000	What we did was to change their overt behavior.
4901000	4914000	If we had people living in shanty huts made of soapboxes and zinc roofs with a hole in the ground for a water closet
4914000	4923000	and no running water or electricity, life is somewhat rough and ready.
4923000	4939000	You put them into high rises with lifts and running hot and cold and power, all the other amenities of life.
4939000	4944000	You cannot behave the way you did when you lived in a shanty hut.
4944000	4950000	I give you a simple illustration.
4950000	4957000	I discussed it this morning, but I think I might as well tell you, you might find this difficult to believe.
4957000	4962000	Having moved in there, they know they've got a water closet.
4962000	4970000	But they like to be a source of annoyance to their neighbors, so they will urinate in the lifts
4970000	4976000	so that everybody would be in convenience.
4976000	4993000	So to overcome this, our housing authority devised a special mechanism that will make the lifts stop.
4993000	4999000	And you will be apprehended.
4999000	5008000	To defeat that, they press the button, they stand outside and pee into it.
5008000	5013000	To defeat that, we installed a camera.
5013000	5019000	So it's like mine warfare, submarine, mine, anti-mine.
5019000	5029000	It goes to show just how tenacious people are in making a nuisance of themselves to other people.
5029000	5036000	Why they get satisfaction out of this, I will never understand.
5036000	5046000	But some things are more dangerous when they don't want an old piece of furniture
5046000	5049000	and it's too big to go into the lift.
5049000	5055000	They just go to the veranda and toss it out.
5055000	5061000	And people have been killed on the pavement below.
5061000	5073000	So we now have a law which says if you do that, it's a crime and you will go to jail and you will lose your flat.
5073000	5082000	And the next time you get housing, you will be on the ground floor.
5082000	5088000	So you see how difficult it is to change people's habits.
5088000	5092000	But nevertheless, we have made them stop spitting.
5092000	5098000	Spitting is a great Chinese tradition from time immemorial.
5098000	5105000	If you go to China, if I were in Shenzhen or in Hong Kong, I wouldn't try this campaign.
5105000	5112000	They'll just turn around and tell me, our great-grandfathers did this, don't tell me to do different.
5112000	5119000	But in Singapore, having transplanted ourselves, we then explained to them not only is it disgusting,
5119000	5123000	it will spread tuberculosis and so many other things.
5123000	5128000	And we educated the boys and girls in school, had it on television,
5128000	5135000	then when we had confined it to a minority who hawk and spit into the street,
5135000	5138000	then we fined them and punished them.
5138000	5144000	And I'm proud to say that when Deng Xiaoping came to visit Singapore in 1978,
5144000	5150000	he was amazed that there was no spitting.
5150000	5159000	So I had provided for him a Ming white and blue spittoon.
5159000	5164000	I absolutely did, because when I went to the Great Hall of the People,
5164000	5173000	they had these spittoons, and it's a great Chinese culture to do this.
5173000	5179000	But when he found that nobody else in Singapore did this, he did not make use of it.
5179000	5185000	The next time I went to the Great Hall of the People, the spittoons had disappeared.
5185000	5190000	So you see, change can come about. It takes time.
5190000	5193000	Other side of the balcony.
5193000	5194000	Me?
5194000	5195000	Yeah.
5195000	5198000	I don't really have a question, but since you've asked me, I will go ahead.
5198000	5200000	No. No.
5200000	5206000	That's okay. That's okay.
5206000	5208000	We're just doing questions.
5208000	5209000	Good evening, Premier Yu.
5209000	5210000	Question.
5210000	5218000	I'm Indian by origin, and you've done a remarkable job in Singapore in a few decades.
5218000	5221000	How do you think India can improve in similar ways?
5221000	5230000	Are you familiar, and how do you think the same things can happen within that country?
5230000	5238000	India has been a country that has enormous potential,
5238000	5248000	and for the last five decades have missed many opportunities to achieve its potential.
5248000	5258000	With the IT, it's beginning to emerge as a great player in the IT software business.
5258000	5264000	I'm told it's because there's no ministry to regulate it.
5264000	5271000	So I was interested to watch your new Minister for IT being questioned.
5271000	5276000	I can't remember whether it was CNBC or CNN or whatever,
5276000	5283000	but he vehemently – he was a very able debater –
5283000	5289000	he vehemently asserted that his job was to help the IT industry not to cripple it,
5289000	5296000	that because IT required 24 hours power, he will ensure that there's enough power throughout India,
5296000	5305000	that power and telephones will be spread all over India so that full advantage can be taken of IT.
5305000	5314000	Well, if he can do that and get his other ministers to do that and change the way the bureaucracy works,
5314000	5318000	India will achieve its potential.
5318000	5323000	I have some reservations because I've had several disappointments.
5323000	5333000	For example, when your last – former Prime Minister Narasingam Rao met my prime minister a few years ago
5333000	5340000	and said, you have seven million foreign tourists come visit you. Why not bring them to India?
5340000	5348000	He said, yes, delighted. So he put up a plan, beautiful sketch plans of hotels that we will build,
5348000	5355000	tour coaches that we will bring, but we needed an airline with landing rights.
5355000	5365000	And he agreed that Singapore Airlines will form a joint venture with Tata and compete against Air India.
5365000	5371000	And all these tourist destinations will be direct flights from Singapore.
5371000	5378000	The minister for civil aviation says, no, this is a family heirloom.
5378000	5387000	The prime minister was overruled. The plan is gathering dust for the last five years.
5387000	5394000	Now a new plan is out to sell Air India up to 40%.
5394000	5401000	So Singapore Airlines is in discussions with Tata to buy 40%.
5401000	5409000	I am tempted – it's not my business, but I was thinking of dropping a little note to the chairman of Singapore Airlines
5409000	5416000	to say, does 40% give us management control?
5416000	5428000	We're putting in, let's say, 20% of that 40% and we'll be run around by Air India management and Air India unions.
5428000	5430000	Where does it go?
5430000	5434000	So why not start a new airline?
5434000	5440000	But then you'll be back to the same old story, so I don't know what's going to happen.
5440000	5442000	We try.
5442000	5446000	This will have to be the last question since we've now run out of our time.
5446000	5449000	Good evening. My name is Prathana Phongpivat.
5449000	5456000	I'm from Thailand, currently a PhD student at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
5456000	5461000	Fletcher School? You're not in Harvard.
5461000	5465000	They take courses here. We're very closely related.
5465000	5467000	Well, I did.
5467000	5475000	I was impressed by your speech about how much you have shaped Singapore to be one of the leading world countries.
5475000	5481000	And you, however, did not really touch upon some problems in Singapore.
5481000	5492000	And my question is, how would you address some problems like the underpopulation and the lack of working class?
5492000	5501000	Or how do you concern about the encouragement of the government to try to encourage more birth rate
5501000	5509000	and the unbalance of racial ratio that you try to keep?
5509000	5512000	I didn't catch the last few.
5512000	5526000	The racial imbalance that is going to arise from the encouragement of government to try to increase birth rate in some of the area or some of the rest?
5526000	5531000	This is a very serious problem. I'm not sure that the incentives are going to work.
5531000	5546000	Our birth rates, fertility rates, have gone down from the 1970s where we were about 2.8, 2.9 average per woman.
5546000	5551000	Now it's about 1.5.
5551000	5558000	And for the educated woman, it's 1.4. For the uneducated, it's about 1.6, 1.7.
5558000	5566000	The Malays are just replacing themselves, 2.1, 2.2. The Indians are not replacing themselves.
5566000	5571000	They are also around 1.8, 1.9.
5571000	5578000	So all these concessions will produce a minor spurt and then it will tail off.
5578000	5585000	We did that the last time in 1985. It moved upwards and it tailed off.
5585000	5599000	The problem is a very difficult one to solve. It's got to do with changing lifestyles and changing values and a self-centered way of life.
5599000	5607000	Why do I want children? It hampers my career development. I want to see the world.
5607000	5616000	I want both incomes to enable us to fulfill our lives.
5616000	5624000	What's the profit in two children? Well, one may be good enough and we can concentrate everything on one.
5624000	5631000	They're also marrying later, having trouble having children.
5631000	5635000	I'm not sure we can reverse it because it's a worldwide trend.
5635000	5643000	The French have been partially successful. It's got nothing to do with the racial imbalance.
5643000	5653000	The Muslims are slightly above average, 2.2, 2.3, but they're not multiplying by all that number
5653000	5672000	because they are also trapped in this desire for higher quality of life, travel, more of the comforts of wealth and the consumer society.
5672000	5684000	Fortunately, we are a small population, so we are selectively encouraging immigration from other parts of the world,
5684000	5694000	and not just from Asia. We recruit actively from all the universities in the world.
5694000	5702000	Those who come are mostly from Asia, but there are many who are from Europe, and they have also come to do work here.
5702000	5708000	Of our population of 4 million, 3 million are Singaporeans, 1 million are foreigners.
5708000	5715000	You might find this difficult to believe, but we have an economy that requires workers.
5715000	5725000	1 million are foreigners. Of them, about 800,000 to 900,000 are unskilled and semi-skilled.
5725000	5736000	100,000 are in the white-collar class, and 100,000 are managers and professionals and top executives.
5736000	5742000	Of course, like all the countries, we hope to draw in from the upper brackets
5742000	5754000	because if we allow those from the lower brackets to come in, we have 1 billion Indians and 1.3 billion Chinese,
5754000	5762000	so 4 million Singaporeans will be swamped, so we have to be a little careful.
5762000	5772000	We have created this oasis, and oasis can be stifled, so let's make sure that the spring water is flowing,
5772000	5780000	grass remains green, and don't have too many goats eating up the grass.
5780000	5784000	May I try to persuade the senior minister to take a question?
5784000	5793000	I'm sorry, we are now a good 10 minutes after our time, so we cannot take more questions,
5793000	5800000	but I do hope you will join me in thanking Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew for his trying performance here tonight.
5800000	5821000	Thank you very much.
5830000	5854000	Thank you.
